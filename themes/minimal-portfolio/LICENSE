You are completely free to use this template for your personal use or as a work for your client as long as you keep the link at the template footer pointing to our partner and us.

If you would prefer removing the backlink from the theme footer, please purchase the attribution-free license at the theme page at https://bootstrapious.com/attribution-free-license.

However, you cannot redistribute the template nor its derivatives on the internet - neither for free or commercially (e.g., selling it on a marketplace).

Also, as a bonus for license owners, I can provide you the SASS files for even easier template customization. Drop me a line at hello@bootstrapious.com after purchasing the license.

Thank you for understanding and respecting the license conditions.
